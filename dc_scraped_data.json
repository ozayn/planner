      "description": "September 27, 2025\u2013January 11, 2026 Centre Street Building, Level 1 Animals played an important role in ancient Egyptian society, both in life and in the afterlife, where they were variously viewed as predators, pets, pests, sources of food, and symbols of the gods. One mysterious and fascinating aspect of ancient Egyptian culture was its practice of mummification, which extended to include the preservation of animal remains from a variety of species, including dogs, cats, birds, snakes, and more. Millions of mummified animals have been excavated at more than 30 burial sites across Egypt, leading to questions about how and why these animals were mummified.",
