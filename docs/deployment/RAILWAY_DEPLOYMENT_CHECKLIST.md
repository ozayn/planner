# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Current Configuration Status

### Files Ready:
- ✅ `Procfile` - Correctly configured with gunicorn
- ✅ `railway.json` - Proper Railway configuration
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Python 3.13.0 specified
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - All dependencies included

### App Configuration:
- ✅ Database URI handles Railway PostgreSQL automatically
- ✅ Port configuration uses Railway's PORT environment variable
- ✅ Debug mode properly configured for production
- ✅ Host set to 0.0.0.0 for Railway

## 🔧 Potential Issues & Solutions

### 1. Database Migration
**Issue**: Database tables might not exist on Railway
**Solution**: Add database initialization to deployment

### 2. Data Loading
**Issue**: JSON data files might not be loaded
**Solution**: Add data loading to startup process

### 3. Import Paths
**Issue**: Scripts imports might fail in production
**Solution**: Ensure all imports work in Railway environment

### 4. Environment Variables
**Issue**: Missing required environment variables
**Solution**: Set all required variables in Railway dashboard

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Initialize**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   ```

3. **Add PostgreSQL Database**:
   ```bash
   railway add postgresql
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   railway variables set FLASK_ENV=production
   railway variables set SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   ```

5. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

6. **Initialize Database**:
   ```bash
   railway run python scripts/data_manager.py load
   ```

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Run commands in Railway environment
railway run python -c "from app import app; print('App loaded successfully')"

# Check database connection
railway run python -c "from app import app, db; app.app_context().push(); print('Database connected')"
```
