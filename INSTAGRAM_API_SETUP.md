# Instagram API Setup Guide

## Overview
Instagram API access is limited and complex. Here are the main options:

## Option 1: Instagram Basic Display API
**Purpose**: Access your own Instagram data
**Limitations**: 
- Only works for accounts you own
- Cannot access other public profiles
- Limited to basic profile info and media

### Setup Steps:
1. Create Facebook Developer Account at https://developers.facebook.com/
2. Create a new app (type: "Other")
3. Add "Instagram Basic Display" product
4. Configure OAuth redirect URIs
5. Get App ID and App Secret

### Required Permissions:
- `instagram_graph_user_profile`
- `instagram_graph_user_media`

## Option 2: Instagram Graph API  
**Purpose**: Business/Creator account management
**Limitations**:
- Only works for Instagram Business/Creator accounts
- Requires Facebook Page connection
- Cannot access arbitrary public profiles
- Requires app review for advanced features

### Setup Steps:
1. Convert Instagram account to Business/Creator
2. Create/link Facebook Page
3. Create Facebook Developer app
4. Add "Instagram" product
5. Configure Facebook Login
6. Request permissions through app review

### Required Permissions:
- `instagram_basic`
- `pages_show_list`
- `pages_read_engagement` (requires review)

## Option 3: Web Scraping (Current Approach)
**Purpose**: Access public profile information
**Limitations**:
- Limited data (no follower counts, bios)
- Instagram actively blocks scraping
- Rate limiting and IP blocking
- Terms of Service concerns

### What We Can Get:
- ✅ Profile URL
- ✅ Username/handle
- ✅ Basic profile existence
- ❌ Follower count
- ❌ Bio/description
- ❌ Recent posts

## Recommendation

For our use case (accessing various public Instagram profiles for event sources), **web scraping is the most practical approach** because:

1. **No API access**: Instagram doesn't provide APIs for accessing arbitrary public profiles
2. **Business requirement**: We need data from accounts we don't own/manage
3. **Simple data needs**: We only need basic profile info (name, URL, handle)

## Enhanced Web Scraping Approach

We can improve our current scraping by:
1. Using more sophisticated headers and session management
2. Implementing proxy rotation (if needed)
3. Adding rate limiting and retry logic
4. Caching results to reduce requests
5. Fallback to manual entry for critical data

## Alternative: Manual Data Entry

For important sources, we can:
1. Use scraping to get basic info
2. Manually research and enter follower counts, bios
3. Set up periodic manual updates
4. Focus on quality over automation

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance current scraper** with better reliability
2. **Add manual override fields** in admin interface
3. **Implement caching** to reduce Instagram requests
4. **Consider paid services** like RapidAPI for Instagram data (if budget allows)
