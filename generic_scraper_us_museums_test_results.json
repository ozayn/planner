Realms of the Dharma: Buddhist Art Across Asiapresents an international survey of Buddhism and Buddhist art, beginning with the religion\u2019s origins in India and following its spread through mainland and island Southeast Asia (Myanmar [Burma], Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia), the Himalayas (Kashmir, Nepal, and Tibet), and East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan). Incorporating 180 masterpieces of pan-Asian Buddhist art, the exhibition introduces key concepts of Buddhist thought and practice viewed through the prism of rare and extraordinarily beautiful Buddhist sculptures, paintings, and ritual objects. Drawn from LACMA\u2019s permanent collection, with several significant loans from private collections, the exhibition explores the life of the Buddha, the role of the bodhisattva or Buddhist savior, Buddhist cosmology, and such key concepts as dharma, karma, nirvana, mantra, mudra, and mandala. The show will focus on art associated with such key phases of Buddhism as Theravada (early monastic Buddhism), Mahayana (the \u201cGreat Vehicle\u201d), Vajrayana (the \u201cDiamond Vehicle\u201d\u2014tantric or esoteric Buddhism), and Chan (Zen).

Incorporating 180 masterpieces of pan-Asian Buddhist art, the exhibition introduces key concepts of Buddhist thought and practice viewed through the prism of rare and extraordinarily beautiful Buddhist sculptures, paintings, and ritual objects. Drawn from LACMA\u2019s permanent collection, with several significant loans from private collections, the exhibition explores the life of the Buddha, the role of the bodhisattva or Buddhist savior, Buddhist cosmology, and such key concepts as dharma, karma, nirvana, mantra, mudra, and mandala. The show will focus on art associated with such key phases of Buddhism as Theravada (early monastic Buddhism), Mahayana (the \u201cGreat Vehicle\u201d), Vajrayana (the \u201cDiamond Vehicle\u201d\u2014tantric or esoteric Buddhism), and Chan (Zen).

          "description": "Claude Monet,Water Lilies, 1907. Oil on canvas. Bequest of Alexander Cochrane. Claude Monet,Water Lilies, 1907. Oil on canvas. Bequest of Alexander Cochrane. The MFA boasts one of the largest collections of the celebrated Impressionist painter Claude Monet\u2019s work outside France. Gallery 252 is dedicated to Monet, providing an immersive experience of his work from the MFA\u2019s holdings and select loans from private collectors. Visitors can engage with how Monet saw and captured the world\u2014from watery reflections to his famed series paintings from the 1890s and beyond, and his innovative perspectives in landscape. The beauty and magic of nature come to life through his nuanced visions of light and atmosphere. Monet returned time and again to his favorite motifs and locations, which often depict familiar sites near where he lived. Curving roads, grain stacks, and poplar trees feature throughout his long career, in early plein-air compositions likeEntrance to the Village at V\u00e9theuil in Winter(1879) and inGrainstack (Sunset)(1891). Experience the bravura brushwork and vivid color of Monet\u2019s late work inWater Lilies, Reflections of Weeping Willows(about 1916\u201319), a new highlight on loan from a private collectionand\u00a0featured in a fully reimagined gallery display. Made about a decade later than any other Monet painting in the MFA\u2019s collection, this late example extends the chronology of Monet\u2019s career on view, giving visitors a deeper and more expansive story of the artist and his work. The large-scale work is remarkable for its deep jewel-toned palette and expressive surface. It captures the emotive and encompassing power of Monet\u2019s increasingly abstract compositions in the last decade of his career.

          "description": "A new perspective on the BMA\u2019s Asian art collection debuts this fall with the addition of works from India, Indonesia, Iran, and Tu\u0308rkiye displayed alongside works from East Asia, resulting in new insights into materials, cultural and technological influences, and exchange and trade. From feasting to writing, the traditions associated with daily life are explored in the first gallery\u2019s variety of ceramics, prints, and textiles. The Museum\u2019s strong holdings in Chinese works of art are showcased in the second gallery with metal and earthenware objects, as well as export porcelain that reveal China\u2019s importance in world trade, its place within Asia\u2019s diverse philosophical and religious systems, and its belief in continued existence beyond a human lifetime. This installation is made possible by the Victor J. Schenk Trust, the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation, and Amy L. Gould and Matthew S. Polk, Jr. The Asian collection is located in the Julius Levy Memorial Gallery. The BMA\u2019s collection of Asian art includes more than 3,200 objects comprised of works from China, Japan, India, Tibet, Southeast Asia, and the Near East. The strength of the collection resides in Chinese ceramics, with a particular depth in mortuary wares from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and utilitarian stonewares from the 11th through the 13th centuries. The extensive textile collection represents Asia\u2019s major cultures. Asian art is also represented in other areas of the BMA\u2019s collection, including Japanese prints and books as well as Contemporary Art. Drawn primarily from the BMA\u2019s collection, the exhibition\u2019s photographs, books, prints, and a hand scroll feature artists born or working in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Many of the photographers began their careers in another field, such as photojournalism, commercial photography, architecture, sculpture, or filmmaking, but they all share a similar engagement with time as a visual reference or part of their creative process. On view for the first time when the exhibition opened in 2016, these stunning garments were made after the lifting of sumptuary laws during Japan\u2019s Edo period (1603\u20131867) when commoners were forbidden to wear showy clothing with colors like red or purple.",
